<p>
This is a useless application for fun that runs on macOS 11 or later with Full HD camera.
It runs both on Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs, but Intel GPU might not be powerful enough for smooth framerate
in complicated effects.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.intlab.soka.ac.jp/~unemi/1/CrazyMirror/">The original version</a>
was developed in 2005 with iSight camera and QuickTime APIs.
It got not working on newer operating system, but finally it revived by full renewal including Metal shader codes.
