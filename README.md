# Crazy Mirror 2

This is a useless application for fun that runs on macOS 11 or later with Full HD camera.

The original version was developed in 2005 with iSight camera and QuickTime APIs.

It got not working on newer operating system, but finally it revived by totally new coding including Metal shader codes.

When you feel tired at your work, please launch this software, shake your head slowly, move your shoulder up and down, blink your eyes, and then take three deep breaths.

If you feel still tired, try another mode by choosing an effect from the popup menu button named **Effects** in the tool bar.
Sorry, but we don't guarantee the effects on your feeling.
